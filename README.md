## Future Improvements
Currently working on (Last updated on September 28, 2024) </br>
✔️ Ordered by priority</br>
- **Improve image processing time:** Improve the app's ability to handle large data more efficiently, possibly through image resizing strategy, converting images to more efficient formats like webp, or Batch Processing Techniques.
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Provide more specific and user-friendly error messages when image processing fails, including possible solutions or retry options.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Ensure the UI is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
- **Image Format Options for Download:** Allow users to choose different image formats (e.g., JPG, TIFF) for download rather than just PNG.
- **Language Support:** Add multi-language support for non-English users.
